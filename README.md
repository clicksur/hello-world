Test repository. Collapsible list - HTML and CSS only
Hello world! I am trying to learn the basics of HTML and CSS code (to start with!) so I am better placed to understand, create and edit parts of my website and eBay shop :)
I like Electro Swing music. It's good. You should check it out.
My first mission with this repository is to make/borrow/steal some code that will allow me to make a collapsible list using only HTML and CSS. NO JAVASCRIPT!!! Most people will say 'just use javascript', and it's probably better, however, this project is for the descriptions section of my eBay listing and due to a recent policy change we are no longer able to use javascript in our listing descriptions. So I've go to get creative :)
